This will eventually be the repo for my personal portfolio website.

I am currently converting my website into a full React application.  This is where I will be referencing projects that I've completed.

Current website: [www.alfyhushairi.com](www.alfyhushairi.com)

I will be doing the design on sketch and using Zeplin to help me construct the UI. Link to Zeplin: [https://zpl.io/scene/agQrBQO](https://zpl.io/scene/agQrBQO)
